# TA-Tools
A collection of tools I've built to assist in grading and organizing my work as a grader/TA

* grading.py is a tool to organize, compile, and execute java source code submissions downloaded in bulk from canvas

* labPartners.py takes a list of students and divides them into random teams of 2. 
  * Teams will be made of all male-male and female-female pairs wherever possible. 
  * A single team of three or a male-female team may be created due to an odd number of students or an extra male and female. 
  * Creating a male-female team is prioritized over cretaing two teams of 3
